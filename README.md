# Project-FPGA
This is the final project made by me and my partner of the course, Digital Systems Laboratory.
We made an advanture video game run on FPGA. It imitates the classic video game Kirby produced by Nintendo. 
The codes and programs can be found in the folder, final_project/rograms. And the detailed mechanisms are explained in final_project_report.
